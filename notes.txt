Planning for dsj 05

Challenge
    Create a detailed page view for each podcast 
    The page must be displayed when the user clicks on a podcast
    The page for the detailed view must be displayed via routing
    Users must be able to navigate different seasonal and genre data 
    Data must be fetched from the provided API 

Centralized state: 
    Using React state or a state management library 
        Not sure yet which I will be using 
            For smaller projects prop drilling is fine 
            I might want to experiment with a global state manager 
            I want to start using un/subscribers even if not needed yet 


Architecture choices:
    Still deciding for the most part 
        Readable state/main (global or drilling)
        Keep the data/behaviour management inside the main App component/state 
        Styling templates and variations in the passed children of components
        Subscribers to listen for specific changes to certian elements or library state management (research needed)

Tips:
    Break down each challenge into smaller chunks/branches for experimentation and learning (solution finding)
    Using vanilla test pages to understand why the framework was created and what the differences are 
    Stick to the brief closely and complete the assignment/task(applies to company level too) as quickly
        as possible then with any extra time create a branch optimizations version for a choice. 
        Unless you are given free reign with regards to design/architecture.
    Starting with a html tailwind page, exporting into a template inside a children tag in a component, might be a more natural workflow

How I will start:
    Create a new html file 
    Create the styling and layout for the page view 
    Create the logic for routing to this page without a reload onclick
    Load the page passing data via params
    Display all the relavent information for the clicked podcast page 
    Create the appropriate navigation for the users 

New workflow tips:
    Start with what you want the browser to display and how (styling) 
    Move to where the data/display elements will come from and pass/set the data 
    Decide what behaviours are neccessary to act on the data at what level of DS 
    Decide which DS are relavent, keep SRP and encapsulation in mind but try to keep behaviour seperate to styling 
    Decide how the functions will pass and update data where needed 
    Create the children components responsible for various renders of different types or just different views of the data 
    Create the parent for the centralized store of the data and the methods that update the store as well as notify the other components of changes relavent to the data they need
